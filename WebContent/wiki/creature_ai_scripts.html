<p><strong><span><span>NOTICE</span>: This guide will assume that you have ScriptDev2 Rev 220+ successfully and completely installed. It is in no way designed to help in the installation procedures of ScriptDev2.</span></strong></p> 
<p><strong>SD2 Revision when this guide was last updated: 838 (could be incomplete)</strong></p> 
<p>Now on to the fun stuff…</p> 
<p>Starting with revision 220, ScriptDev2 has implemented a DB-based scripting design that allows the use of a database (MySQL only right now) to specify the actions that a creature script will do. The script is called eventAI and will be so called throughout the rest of this guide. A basic eventAI script works with and requires only two pieces of information: <u>What to do</u> and <u>When to do it</u>. The first piece of information (the What) will be referred to as the action. Currently, a single eventAI script entry can have up to three actions. The second piece of information (the When) will be referred to as the event. Anyone that wants to create entries for the eventAI script needs to answer the two questions above. Throughout the script’s lifecycle, it will continually perform the actions given when a defined event happens. Some events will only occur once while others can be timed so that they occur at a specified interval.</p> 
<p>Now that the basic idea of the script has been explained, let’s get down to the fun details. For convenience, reference tables will be provided at the end of this article that will contain short descriptions for fast lookup. Here will be included longer and more thorough descriptions. We shall first start out with what events are currently defined by the eventAI script. An event can use up to three different parameters and these parameters control different things depending on the event. If a parameter isn’t specifically named for the event, it will not be used for that event.</p> 
<p>One more thing: event AI can support phases. A "phase" is just a way to group certain events + actions together so that the creature will perform certain actions based on what event it is currently on. The way the phase system works in event AI is that for every event added, it needs to be specified under which phases the event <span>SHOULD</span> <span>NOT</span> occur. This is a bit confusing at first, so let’s look at it more closely. A creature can have more than one phase, up to a max of 32 different phases (with the first one being phase 0, and last one being phase 31). How the phase selection field works is that it contains a 32bit number. Each bit in the number represents a possible phase, with the bit in the least significant position signifying phase 0 and the most significant bit signifying phase 31. The default value of zero in this field has no bits set and since the field controls when the event should <span>NOT</span> trigger, it would then mean that the event will always be triggered independent of the current phase the creature is in. Therefore, if you want to specify what phases the event should occur in, you need to add up all of the corresponding bits for all the other phases where the event shouldn’t trigger in (confusing…yes).</p> 
<p>For example, let’s say that a certain creature using event AI will have a max of four phases. We are then dealing with a 4 bit number in this field. Let’s further say that that certain creature has an event that will only trigger in its phase 2 (a timed spell cast for instance). Then the field should contain all of the phases the event SHOULDN’T be triggered in…then out of the four bits, we leave the <strong>third</strong> bit alone (off) and turn on all of the other bits so we get 1011 which is equal to 11, so we put in 11 as the inverse phase mask for the event entry. As another example, let’s say that the same creature previously mentioned has another event that is only triggered in the phase 0 and phase 3. This would mean that we need to ignore phase 1 and 2, so our bitmask would be 0110 which is equal to 6 so we put in 6 for this event’s inverse phase mask field. Please note that both examples were tailored for a creature with four and only four phases. If you decide to add more phases later on, you will have to redefine all of the nonzero bitmasks for all of the mob’s events.</p> 
<p>Every event also has a chance field that controls the chance of that event actually occurring. Using a value of 0 in this field will make the event never occur. Values are from 0 to 100.</p>

</ul> 
<p>Now that all of the supported events have been listed and described, we shall now move on to the actions that can be performed. Each event can take up to three actions. The actions will all be performed when the event is triggered and they will be performed in the order that they have been defined. This means that, for a certain event, action 1 will be performed first, followed by action 2, then lastly by action 3. Just like event definitions, each action can use up to three different parameters but not all actions will use all three parameters. If a parameter isn’t mentioned for an action, then that action does not need that parameter.</p> 
<p>Before we start to list and explain the different actions that can be taken, we must first look at how the eventAI targeting system works. Due to technical reasons in how targetting is handled, the eventAI script cannot target anything or anyone that is not in its threat list or is not the scripted creature itself. It also can’t currently target anyone specific in its threat list except by their position in the threat list. However, even then it can only target specifically the current victim, the second unit in its threat list, and the last unit in its threat list. It can also target units in its threat list at random and has two options for that: anyone in its threat list at random, or anyone in its threat list excluding the unit with the most threat. Aside from all of those external targets, the script can always target itself. More information on the target types can be found in the reference tables at the end of this guide.</p> 
<p>One last note before we start looking at individual actions is about the texts. The eventAI script has support for localized text entries. Therefore, you can define what the mob will say in more than one language all in another table and the script will show the corresponding localized text to the corresponding client (english text to enUS/enGB clients, german text to deDE clients, etc). All of the localized text entries will have a unique text ID assigned to them and it is that text ID that will be used by any actions that require textual input.</p>

Optionally a entry from other tables can be used (such as <a href="custom_texts).Entry">custom_texts</a> are required to be negative and exist in a *_texts-table. The type text to be displayed are defined in the texts-table itself (Say, Yell, Whisper, Emote Text, Boss Whisper, Boss Emote)Other options are also to be defined in the texts-table, such as a sound to be heard with the text and the language used in output (common, dwarvish, etc).In case this entry has a localized version of the text, the localized text will be displayed in client that support this locale.</li> 
   <li>Parameter 2: Optional. TextId can be defined in addition. The same apply to this as explained above, however eventAI will randomize between the two.</li>
